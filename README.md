# Resume
## Summary
I am a curious and industrious senior seeking to apply academic and professional project experience to challenges in digital signal processing, communications, hardware synthesis and verification, and machine learning.
## Purpose
I am looking for a full time position that offers the chance to work on sophisticated technologies in a challenging, productive environment.


## Education

University of Massachusetts, Amherst:	May 2019
Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, GPA: 3.44
Commonwealth Honors College

## Coursework
### Undergraduate Level Coursework
Digital Signal Processing/Machine Learning, Intro to Communication and Signal Processing, Computer Systems Lab, Electronics I and II, Fields and Waves
### Graduate Level Coursework
Probability and Random Processes, Synthesis and Verification of Digital Systems

## Experience
Arup – Electrical Engineer Intern	Summer 2018
•	Wrote Python script for Revit to automate creation and naming of electrical circuits
•	Demonstrated scripts to electrical team and created a video tutorial for using them
•	Used Revit to create diagrams of electrical fixtures and circuits for review by architect
•	Reviewed contractor submittals against Arup specifications
•	Conducted energy savings and solar feasibility analyses using Excel and AutoCAD

## Projects
### Ultrasonic Mid-Air Haptics	Fall 2018 - Present
•	Prototyping in a team to produce a tactile sensation in a small spatial region with an ultrasonic speaker array
•	Demonstrated constructive interference to engineering faculty with microphone
•	Developed a simulator in MATLAB to calculate and visualize necessary phase shifts
•	Will achieve beamforming by sending an AM signal through a phased array
### Signal Processing in MATLAB	Fall 2017 - Present
•	Designed FIR filter by specifying passband, stopband, and allowed ripples in order to visualize resultant frequency response
•	Computed Fourier transforms to find frequency responses of given function
•	Calculated convolutions with system impulse response to find system responses to given input
•	Plotted complex functions to visualize real/imaginary and phase/magnitude representations
### Musical Instrument Device Interface in C	Fall 2017
•	Worked on a team to program a microcontroller in C to work as a MIDI controller
•	Sampled and parsed bits from MIDI data by using interrupt and receiver subsystems
•	Stored bits into memory with EEPROM subsystem, then played notes from memory
•	Varied speed of playback based on light level across a photocell using analog to digital conversion
### Asynchronous Receiver in Verilog	Fall 2017
•	Worked on a team to design, synthesize an asynchronous receiver for musical data on Altera’s CLPD Max 7000S
•	Simulated design using Altera’s Quartus II 9.1 waveform simulator, and visualized schematic with RTL Viewer
### Logic Synthesis and Verification	Fall 2018
•	Used ABC to perform logic optimization for an FPGA circuit
•	Converted gate level circuit to logic interchange format, then performed technology mapping to standard library
•	Reduced latency and area substantially
### Statistical Natural Language Processing in Python	Spring 2018
•	Used Python’s Natural Language Toolkit to parse linguistic data from different articles
•	Used Excel to establish statistically compare articles to determine optimal linguistic features for classification
